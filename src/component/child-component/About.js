                    Spring boot is module of spring that is used to create spring-based
                    stand-alone application that developer can just run because it needs minimal
                    spring configuration. In spring boot there is no need to configure xml file so developer
                    can focus on development. The main goal of spring boot to reduce developments,
                    unit testing and integration testing time. It has extra support of auto-configuration and
                    embedded application server like tomcat, jetty, etc.
